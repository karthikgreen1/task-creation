Hi 

While executing the main.yml file , the ansible controller validate the main.yml , it checks for all files in the path , if the files is present , it runs sucessfully.
Eventhough we are creating the file at run time our ansible playbook checks whether the file is present or not.
How to overcome this problem. We don't want to hardcode the file name in the playbook.
We are using var_files in ansible playbook section to create a file at run time.   

Thanks & Regards,
Karthik
